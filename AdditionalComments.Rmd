```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r, message = F}
source("cleandata.R")
```

I'm not sure what the death and recovered columns are, but they contain odd data.  Is it a code of some sort?
```{r}
count(covid_data, death)
```
```{r}
count(covid_data, recovered)
```

To make your table of ages make more sense, you could replace your `range` with max/min columns:
```{r}
covid_data %>%
  summarize(
    count = n(),
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_age = sd(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_age = median(age, na.rm = TRUE), 
    max_age = max(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_age = min(age, na.rm = T)
      )
```
